# Road emissions visualization

## Context 
The aim of this project is to visualise the estimated CO2 emissions of 8k routes in Austria. 
I produced this visualisation for a consulting company in a very short space of time (the map had to be delivered within 2 days). The code is therefore far from optimal but the final result is convincing and meets the requirements.
